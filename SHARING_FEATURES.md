# 🎉 New Sharing Features - Kentucky Sports Chronicle

## What's Been Fixed & Added

### ✅ 404 Error - FIXED!

**The Problem:**
- Article links resulted in 404 errors when shared directly
- Example: `yoursite.com/article/some-article` → 404 Not Found

**The Solution:**
- Added SPA routing configuration files:
  - `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
  - `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
  - `public/_redirects` - Universal fallback
- These tell the server to serve `index.html` for all routes
- React Router then handles the routing client-side

**Now:** Share article links freely - they work perfectly! 🎯
